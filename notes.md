markets = CSV.read('./support/markets.csv')
# markets variable now one big array representing table. # each table row an array, our markets

  CSV.foreach('./support/markets.csv') do |row|

## Module: The module provides a namespace for the application. A namespace ensures the classes we create will not 'collide' or 'overlap' with a class that could exist elsewhere in a codebase (like in a gem).

Baseline Requirements

Create a class for each of the data types listed above. Each class should be a part of the FarMar module.
You should be able to create instances of these classes that know about their associated data file.
Create your far_mar.rb file which will bring together all classes created in the previous step.

# does that mean will have the same amount of classes per data type listed?
Or, will it be only for things we don' t repeat?

#FarMar::Market
7 Classes?
ID - (Fixnum) a unique identifier for that market
Name - (String) the name of the market (not guaranteed unique)
Address - (String) street address of the market
City - (String) city in which the market is located
County - (String) county in which the market is located
State - (String) state in which the market is located

# FarMar::Product
