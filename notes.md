## Notes
TRISH you will need to clean this up later!!
#ERROR

From in the main project folder (folder that holds far_mar.rb and rakefile), run: $

ruby ./lib/vendors.rb
-- Thanks Emily!

/Users/trishgriego/ada/week5/FarMar/lib/markets.rb:77:in `<top (required)>': undefined method `vendors' for FarMar::Markets:Class (NoMethodError)
	from /Users/trishgriego/ada/week5/FarMar/far_mar.rb:13:in `require_relative'
	from /Users/trishgriego/ada/week5/FarMar/far_mar.rb:13:in `<top (required)>'

  def market
    puts "market: #{market}"
    market = FarMar::Markets.find(market_id)
    return market
  end
THIS CAUSES A RECURSSION.

# WHAT DID I DO TO FIX THIS ERROR?
1. Checked to see if it was being required at the top. Turns out it needs to be called at the top.
2. Glad I rememberd to use ruby lib/markets.rb to run from main folder.
3. if vendor.id == @id
instead of if vendor.id == market.find(id)
As it would be easier to grab id with instance variable.
4. vendor_test = FarMar::Markets.all[0]
puts vendor_test.vendors


"only put return in a loop when you want ONE THING. and the first thing it would find. "- jamie





Trish, after going through list of things terminal tells you. when you get no method error. One the first things you check should be.. do you have permission to access that thing??
<!-- ng one instance in the product class return the products I'm looking for (first in line)ERROR (0.11s)
NoMethodError:         NoMethodError: undefined method `name' for #<FarMar::Products:0x007fbd8d731110> -->




# TRISH: Rake wants to see ONE dot. If you're testing things prior to going to rake. ie the terminal. Use 2 dots OR use the following set up:
old way to run: ruby vendors.rb
The better way: ruby lib/vendors.rb

#------------#
1. Get your data into a comma seperatted format.
markets = CSV.read('./support/markets.csv')
# markets variable now one big array representing table. # each table row an array, our markets

  CSV.foreach('./support/markets.csv') do |row|
    puts row.inspect
  end

## Module: The module provides a namespace for the application. A namespace ensures the classes we create will not 'collide' or 'overlap' with a class that could exist elsewhere in a codebase (like in a gem).

Baseline Requirements

Create a class for each of the data types listed above. Each class should be a part of the FarMar module.
You should be able to create instances of these classes that know about their associated data file.
Create your far_mar.rb file which will bring together all classes created in the previous step.

# does that mean will have the same amount of classes per data type listed?
Or, will it be only for things we don' t repeat?

#FarMar::Market
7 Classes?
ID - (Fixnum) a unique identifier for that market
Name - (String) the name of the market (not guaranteed unique)
Address - (String) street address of the market
City - (String) city in which the market is located
County - (String) county in which the market is located
State - (String) state in which the market is located
Zip - (String) zipcode in which the market is located

#FarMar::Vendor
5 classes?
ID - (Fixnum) uniquely identifies the vendor
Name - (String) the name of the vendor (not guaranteed unique)
No. of Employees - (Fixnum) How many employees the vendor has at the market
Market_id - (Fixnum) a reference to which market the vendor attends

# FarMar::Product
3 classes?
ID - (Fixnum) uniquely identifies the product
Name - (String) the name of the product (not guaranteed unique)
Vendor_id - (Fixnum) a reference to which vendor sells this product

#FarMar::Sale
5 classes?
ID - (Fixnum) uniquely identifies the sale
Amount - (Fixnum) the amount of the transaction, in cents (i.e., 150 would be $1.50)
Purchase_time - (Datetime) when the sale was completed
Vendor_id - (Fixnum) a reference to which vendor completed the sale
Product_id - (Fixnum) a reference to which product was sold
